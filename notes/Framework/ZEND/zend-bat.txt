the view script rendered is views/scripts/{controller
name}/{action_name}.phtml


Each page of the application is known as an action and actions are grouped into controllers.
For a URL of the format http://localhost/zf-tutorial/public/news/view, the controller is News
and the action is view.
Zend Framework’s MVC system also supports modules for
grouping controllers together.

By default, Zend Framework’s controller reserves a special action called index as a default action. This is
for cases like http://localhost/zf-tutorial/public/news/ where the index action within the
News controller will be executed. There is also a default controller name, which is also called index and so
the URL http://localhost/zf-tutorial/public/ will cause the index action in the Index
controller to be executed.

Setting up the Controller
We are now ready to set up our controller. In Zend Framework, the controller is a class that must be called
{Controller name}Controller. Note that {Controller name} must start with a capital letter. This
class must be within a file called {Controller name}Controller.php within the application/
controllers directory. Each action is a public function within the controller class that must be named
{action name}Action. In this case {action name} starts with a lower case letter and again must be
completely lowercase. Mixed case controller and action names are allowed, but have special rules that you
must understand before you use them. Check the documentation first!
