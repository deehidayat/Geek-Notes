 $(document).ready(function() {
   $("#orderedlist").find("li").each(function(i) {
     $(this).append( " BAM! " + i );
   });
 });
find() allows you to further search the descendants of the already selected elements, therefore $("#orderedlist").find("li") is mostly the same as $("#orderedlist li").

each() iterates over every element and allows further processing. Most methods, like addClass(), use each() themselves.

In this example, append() is used to append some text to it and set it as text to the end of each element.


This code selects the first form element and calls reset() on it. In case you had more than one form, you could also do this:

 $(document).ready(function() {
   // use this to reset several forms at once
   $("#reset").click(function() {
     $("form").each(function() {
       this.reset();
     });
   });
 });

$("form").reset() to reset all the forms on the page.
